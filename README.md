A collection of GitHub Actions Workflows to be reused in other projects

## About

This repository contains GitHub Actions Workflows that are shared for my other repos.
Some of these actions are based on the [addons-workflow-repository].

It maintains all our reusable workflows in a single place.

While these workflows are public, they are subjected to change and not
versioned in terms of releases. They also might not work outside the scope
of my projects. For these reasons, using them from this repository directly
for other project is not recommended.

## Changelog & Releases

This repository isn't versioned (in terms of releases).

If you want to see what has changed, please see the commit history of the
main branch: <https://github.com/coostax/ghactions-workflows/commits/main>
